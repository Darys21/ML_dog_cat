# Cats and Dogs Image Classification Project

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and focuses on training a convolutional neural network model to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Overview
The project utilizes TensorFlow and the Keras API to build and train the model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of images of cats and dogs. The dataset can be obtained from the FreeCodeCamp project data repository.

## Project Structure
- `cat_dog_script.py`: Contains the main code for training and evaluating the model.
- `Copy_of_fcc_cat_dog.ipynb`: A modified version of the original Google Colab notebook used for data preprocessing and model training.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing information about the project.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset using the provided link in the code.
3. Run `cat_dog_script.py` to train, evaluate, and test the model.
4. Check the model's accuracy in identifying cats and dogs images.

## Results
After training the model, it is tested on a set of images. The model's accuracy is calculated, aiming for a minimum of 63% accuracy to pass the challenge.
